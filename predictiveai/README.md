  - [Github - TimeGPT](https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla)
- [Github - Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts): python module offers a consistent ùòßùò™ùòµ() and ùò±ùò≥ùò¶ùò•ùò™ùò§ùòµ() interface across various forecasting models, from classical methods like ARIMA to deep learning models.  This makes it easy to compare and switch between different models without needing to understand their internal workings
- [Github - Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet): designed for users with limited statistical knowledge, allowing them to easily handle seasonal effects and missing data. Its intuitive interface makes it accessible for business applications requiring quick and interpretable forecasts.
- [Github - SKtime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime) provides a scikit-learn-compatible framework for time series analysis, enabling users to apply machine learning techniques seamlessly. This integration allows for easy model tuning, validation, and deployment using familiar tools. You can also easily use embedded scikit-learn data transformers for feature generation
- [Github - GluonTS](https://github.com/jgasthaus/gluon-ts) is focused on probabilistic forecasting, allowing users to generate not just point forecasts but also confidence intervals.
