n8n is one of the world’s most popular low-code workflow automation platforms. Critically,
it allows you to easily mix traditional business workflows with AI agents.

**What’s the difference between n8n, Make, OpenAI Agent Builder and other agentic
frameworks?**

Orchestration beats agency:
> In 14 Principles of Building AI Agents, I argued that you shouldn’t make everything an AI
agent. In 2025, orchestration beats agency — it’s cheaper, faster, and more reliable
especially for processes where you can’t afford 10% failure rate in production. Still, most
agentic platforms lack a flexible non-AI orchestration layer.

In a recent interview, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI co-founder stated:
> “They don’t have enough intelligence, they’re not multimodal enough, they can’t do
computer use and all this stuff.” — Dwarkesh Patel YouTube channel, Oct 17, 2025

The next day, he followed up on X:
> “On LLM agents. My critique of the industry is more in overshooting the tooling w.r.t.
present capability. I live in what I view as an intermediate world where I want to
collaborate with LLMs and where our pros/cons are matched up. The industry lives in a
future where fully autonomous entities collaborate in parallel to write all the code and
humans are useless.” — Andrej Karpathy on X, Oct 18, 2025

n8n fixes this by combining powerful agentic capabilities with one of the best workflow
automation engines.

### How to Host n8n?

As an individual or a small team, you’ll most likely use a free, self-hosted Community
Edition. You can install it locally using Docker, or leverage a third-party hosting that runs 24/7.
