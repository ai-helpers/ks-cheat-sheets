A small language model (SLM) is a transformer-based neural network with fewer parameters (millions-low billions) than large models.

It trades broad generalization for efficiency, offering faster inference, lower memory use, and easier deployment on edge devices.

They creaeted with techniques like quantization, pruning and distillation.
Further compressing size while retaining task-specific accuracy.
