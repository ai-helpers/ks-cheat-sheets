# Responsible AI - Trustworthy AI - Strategy

AI governance requires tailored approaches—not one-size-fits-all solutions. This playbook helps organizations build
frameworks aligned with their unique risk profiles, regulatory obligations, and values while maintaining flexibility to
evolve with technology and regulation.

## Five Imperatives for AI Governance

- **Build a Use Case Inventory:** Maintain a central registry of all AI systems, capturing purpose,
data sources, risk level, and ownership. You can't govern what you can't see.
- **Translate Principles into Practice:**: Link fairness to bias audits, transparency to explainability
standards, and accountability to escalation protocols. Make values operational.
- **Embed AI Governance into Existing Structures:** Incorporate AI risk into board agendas,
enterprise risk frameworks, procurement reviews, and internal audit plans.
- **Treat Policy Development as a Living Process:** Establish regular review cycles to keep
frameworks current as regulations evolve and risks emerge. A static policy is a risk.
- **Equip Boards and Staff with the Right Questions:** Provide tailored guidance through
practical tools like risk checklists and oversight questions to build a culture of accountability.

## Regulatory Landscape for AI Technologies

- OECD AI Principles;
- Singapore Model AI Governance Framework.
- EU AI Act (and General‑Purpose AI Code of Practice).
- The NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
- ISO/IEC 42001,30 and ISO/IEC 23894.
- China's Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services.

## Benefits AI Policy

A well-crafted AI policy should do more than codify
good intentions. It should act as a practical mechanism
to ensure the deployment of AI systems reflects
meaningful responsibility, mitigates harms, and is
subject to appropriate oversight.8 Developed rigorously,
an AI policy helps organisations to:

- **Anchor organisational values and ethical principles** in enforceable standards to guide
safe deployment and restrict misuse.
- **Strengthen accountability**, enabling checks and balances, clear oversight mechanisms, and
transparent decision-making processes.
- **Stay responsive to public scrutiny**, treating regulatory compliance as a floor wh
- F**oster trust and open communication** with internal and external stakeholders, promoting
inclusive and socially grounded applications of AI.
- **Mitigate downstream and systemic risks**, particularly where these disproportionately
impact vulnerable groups or the environment.
- **Facilitate responsible innovation**, enabling teams to deploy and scale AI solutions
confidently where appropriate - knowing that clear guidelines, redress pathways and risk
controls are in place.
